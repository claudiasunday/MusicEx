    <h3> A quick story about Jorja</h3>   
     <article class="container"> 
            <h4>Who is she?</h4>
            <p class="text"> Jorja Alice Smith is an English singer and songwriter who has delivered many chartbusting singles throughout her career. The relatively new artist has already made a mark on the music industry and has been nominated for multiple prestigious awards, including a Grammy. Smith has collaborated with popular artists like Kendrick Lamar, Stromzy and Drake, but it is her own creations which have proven to be most successful for her career. She released her extended play in 2016, marking her debut in the music industry. Smith began trending on popular music streaming websites and apps after releasing singles like ‘Let Me Down’ and ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’. She then released her first studio album ‘Lost & Found’, which broke into top charts nationally and internationally. She was influenced by Amy Winehouse’s music while growing up and listened to a lot of reggae, pop and R&B songs. She started writing songs as a kid and continued to hone her skills over the years before eventually making her debut. The young artist may have found success quite early in her career, but clearly, it has not happened overnight.</p>

<h4>BE RIGHT BACK TRANSPARENT RED VINYL </h4>
<p> echa de lanzamiento: 27/08/2021</p>
<p>orja Smith returns to announce a new 8-track project. ‘Be Right Back’ is due May 14th and is the first body of work from Jorja since her 2019 critically-acclaimed, Mercury Prize nominated debut album ‘Lost & Found’, for which she won her second BRIT Award for ‘Best Female’ and earned herself a nomination for ‘New Artist’ at the GRAMMY Awards.

    The project finds Jorja delivering some of the most emotive and imaginative songs of her career. Over string-heavy production, she unveils a collection of songs that are diverse in their range but still extremely cohesive as a body of work - “It’s called be right back because it’s just something I want my fans to have right now, this isn’t an album and these songs wouldn’t have made it. If I needed to make these songs, then someone needs to hear them too.” - Jorja says of the project.

<h4>LOST & FOUND CD ALBUM</h4>
<p> Fecha de lanzamiento: 08/06/2018 </p>
<p> ‘Lost & Found’ is the rich fruit of Jorja’s past two years of work and an artistic statement. On her debut offering, Smith’s playfully infectious pop spirit intertwines with her youthful charisma, idiosyncratic storytelling, and informed opinions – attributes that have set her apart from her peers and seen her become one of the UK’s most-loved female-breakthrough stars of recent years.  A sonic masterclass, ‘Lost & Found’ spans a number of personal, and observational yet relatable topics that only Jorja Smith could unite so compellingly. The album, which Jorja has written across the past 3 years, from the age of 17 to 20, includes previously released singles “Blue Lights’, ‘Teenage Fantasy’ and ‘Where Did I Go?’
